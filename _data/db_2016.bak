  "description": [
    "Computational requirements on information processing systems are nowadays enormous - not only huge amounts of data needs to be processed and classified but also the systems need to deal with massive data usually in the form of data streams and frequently real-time processing requirements. On the other hand, neural systems proved their great potential, especially in pattern recognition and computer vision. However, all of the above rely heavily on efficient algorithms and continuously improved implementations. Therefore computational aspects become a key issue in pattern recognition and computer vision.",
    "In this workshop we wish to collect researchers and practitioners to share interesting research topics and ideas especially in the area of computational aspects of pattern recognition and computer vision processed on all types of neural systems, starting from algorithm design and up to implementations and applications, encountered in computer vision and pattern recognition computer vision for information mining, especially form from massive data streams and new neural architectures."
