  "description": [
    "Life sciences, ranging from medicine, biology and genetics to biochemistry and pharmacology have developed rapidly in previous years. Computerization of those domains allowed to gather and store enormous collections of data. Analysis of such vast amounts of information without any support is impossible for human being. Therefore recently machine learning and pattern recognition methods have attracted the attention of broad spectrum of experts from life sciences domain.",
    "The aim of this Workshop is to stress the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between life and computer sciences and to provide an international forum for both practitioners seeking new cutting-edge tools for solving their domain problems and theoreticians seeking interesting and real-life applications for their novel algorithms. We are interested in novel machine learning technologies, designed to tackle complex medical, biological, chemical or environmental data that take into consideration the specific background knowledge and interactions between the considered problems. We look for novel applications of machine learning and pattern recognition tools to contemporary life sciences problems, that will shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. We are interested in new methods for data visualization and methods for accessible presentation of results of machine learning analysis to life scientists. We welcome new findings in the intelligent processing of non-stationary medical, biological and chemical data and in proposals for efficient fusion of information coming from multiple sources. Papers on efficient analysis and classification of bid data (understood as both massive volumes and high-dimensionality problems) will be of special interest to this Workshop."

    "biogram": "Jerzy Stefanowski is a professor of Poznan University of Technology, Institute of Computing Science. He received his Ph.D. and Habilitation degrees from the same University. His research interests include knowledge discovery, data mining, machine learning and intelligent decision support. Major results are concerned with: induction of various types of rules, multiple classifiers, mining class - imbalanced data, incremental learning from evolving data streams, data preprocessing, generalizations of rough set theory, descriptive clustering of documents and medical applications. He is the author and co-author of over 170 research papers and 2 books. In addition to his research activities he served in a number of organizational capacities, as e.g.: Former President of Wielkopolska Regional Branch of Polish Information Processing Society (2006-2011), current member of the Executive Board of Polish Artificial Intelligence Society; co-founder and co-leader of Polish Special Interest Group on Machine Learning. Moreover, since 2012 he is the Editor in Chief of Foundations of Computing and Decision Science journal.",
